Savage Image
============

This is an element for loading SVG elements into the DOM, and making them queryable in a basic fashion. It is a stripped-down version of the svg-map element `described in this article <https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/tag-soup-using-custom-elements-cover-elections/>`_, and does not have full functionality yet. It pairs well with Savage Query and Savage Camera.
